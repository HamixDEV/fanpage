    Unitted today is a completely differnt team as sinc Sir Alex 
    retired many coaches hav come and gone and one coach that seems 
    to be stayng for a while is Jose Mourhino who leads a relitively 
    new starting XI. They're a little slow to start as theirs turmoil 
    between the coach and the players. They've also had their worst start 
    in 20 years in the Premier Leauge now sitting at 8th place to 
    low for a club like Manchester. Today rhey're second 
    in their group being beaten by Jueventes last 
    Tuesday.But even if the Red Devils are having a rocky start
    , I still stand United.
