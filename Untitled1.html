    <div> Manchester United is a futbol club that plays  in the Premier League; an competitive football with many 
    other clubs fighting for the premier league title each year. United had begun as early as the late 19th century. 
    Its predicessor.In 1878 the Newton Heath L&YR Football Club was established but during its 1892-1893 they changed 
    its named to Manchester United in 1902 and went on to win the FA and division one champions and moved to Old Trafford
    in 1910 their iconic stadium to the day. After that futbol had went on a break due the Great War; they had started 
    out strong but began a yo-yo club; a club that bounces back between leagues at the top of the division below and 
    being regulated once again. This all changed in 1986 when a new manager by the name of Sir Alex Ferguson was 
    appointed as manager; he had basically made the club an extreme threat and is know as one of the greatest coaches 
    of all time and resigned in 2013.

    <div id="siralex">Manchester United became known as one of the greatest club when they hired 
    Sir Alex Ferguson as their head coach and led them from 1986 to 2013. He was so 
    great that he was knighted in 1999 for his contribution to the football world in 
    europe. He had a rocky start but after that he had done the first and the impossible. 
    He had did the treble and the first of its kind, winning the premier league, UEFA Champions 
    league and the FA and knighted because of that in 1999. He had also taught some of the 
    greatest players in the world. He resigned with 25+ major trophies, below is some
    of those great players</div>

            <div class="title" id="utoday">United Today</div>
    Unitted today is a completely differnt team as sinc Sir Alex 
    retired many coaches hav come and gone and one coach that seems 
    to be stayng for a while is Jose Mourhino who leads a relitively 
    new starting XI. They're a little slow to start as theirs turmoil 
    between the coach and the players. They've also had their worst start 
    in 20 years in the Premier Leauge now sitting at 8th place to 
    low for a club like Manchester. Today rhey're second 
    in their group being beaten by Jueventes last 
    Tuesday.But even if the Red Devils are having a rocky start
    , I still stand United.
